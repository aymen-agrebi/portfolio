        <p>
          As a nerd 🙃, I learned to code from a very young age 👶 in various
          computer languages (c++, vhdl, java, javascript, PHP, python...) and I
          created personal projects🚀, and other professional ones as a
          freelance. With more then 3 years experience just in web apps
          developement 😎, now im a full time MERN-stack developer 👑, I
          mastered the different technical steps of the creation of a web
          application 🙉 starting with analyzing the needs from the
          specifications defined by the customer 👽, implementing the mockups
          🖥️, database modeling , to the frontend and backend development 💪,
          including the testing and the maintenance. 🎢
